# BestFriendFinder

Best Friend Finder is a web application developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
It consists of two dictionaries. One has the possible owners as key and a list of their favorite dogs and vice-versa(both generated randomly every time the program runs). 
The algorithm will then find the best possible matches.
